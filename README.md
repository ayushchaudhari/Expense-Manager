# Expense Manager
By-Ayush Chaudhari

This is the clean java swing project which can create a record of your expense and show you the expenses you have done in the given period of time i.e. basically it is made to keep track of your expenses.
The main source code is there in the src/expense/manager directory. Note-The class which is executable in source is named as OpeningPage.java as the void main is defined in that file itself and then furthur the new classes are integrated to it.
The lib folder consist of the libraries which are basically required to run this project. Basically this project needs a jdbc connector out of the box. As the jdbc connector is required to connect to the database as we have to save the records of the users as well as there expense records are saved in a database.
The already build executable jar file is there which can be directly executed on your pc as an expense manager app.
